# Final Degree Project

This repository hosts my final degree project of my double bachelor degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at [ETSIIT](https://etsiit.ugr.es/).

The whole implementation of the ray tracer is based on a [Ray Tracing](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series.

First you need to install [doctl](). You can check [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-doctl-the-official-digitalocean-command-line-client) to learn the basics commands.
